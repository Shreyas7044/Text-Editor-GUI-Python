## How It Works
We use Tkinter widgets:
- Two Button widgets → Open & Save
- One Text widget → To type & edit text
- Frame widget to hold buttons

The window layout is divided into:
- Left side → Buttons
- Right side → Text editor

The layout is responsive so when resizing the window, the text box resizes too.
